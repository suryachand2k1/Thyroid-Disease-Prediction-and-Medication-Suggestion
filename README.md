# Thyroid Disease Prediction and Medication Suggestion Using SVM

This project uses the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to predict thyroid disease and suggest appropriate medications. It aims to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing and managing thyroid-related conditions more effectively.

## Features

- Utilizes patient report data to predict thyroid disease risk.
- Offers medication and diet suggestions for identified risks.
- Employs SVM for accurate and reliable predictions.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone [your-repo-link]
cd [your-repo-name]
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the script to input patient data and receive predictions and suggestions.

```python
python ThyroidDiseasePrediction.py
```

## Documentation

Further documentation is available [here](link-to-documentation).

## Running Tests

To run tests:

```bash
pytest
```

## Deployment

Guidelines for deploying this application in a clinical setting are included.

## Built With

- Python - Primary programming language
- SciKit-Learn - Used for implementing SVM
- Pandas & NumPy - For data manipulation
